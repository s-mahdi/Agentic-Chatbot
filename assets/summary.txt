Delivering Frontâ€‘End Engineer with 5+ years in React/Next.js & TypeScript.
I help product & SaaS teams modernize legacy frontâ€‘ends, reduce page load by 20â€“40%, stabilize testing/CI to cut build time by ~25%, and accelerate UI delivery by ~25%â€”on products used by 100K+ users. 
Impact snapshots:

 ðŸ’  Reduced 20% initial load via featureâ€‘flagged Backboneâ†’React migration (webpack/codeâ€‘splitting), improving firstâ€‘interaction speed.

ðŸ’  Cut 25% CI time by stabilizing E2E/integration/unit tests (Jest/Vitest/Playwright/Cypress), increasing release cadence.

 ðŸ’  Decreased 40% page load with granular lazyâ€‘loading, boosting task completion on a critical workflow.

 ðŸ’  Improved +15% team productivity by shipping realâ€‘time meetings/chat (WebRTC/mediasoup with React/Next.js), shortening decision cycles.

Culture & ways of working:
Mentor & code reviewer (grew juniorsâ€™ delivery up to +40%), facilitation with design/product, usability testing with end users, Agile/Scrum, and asyncâ€‘first remote.
